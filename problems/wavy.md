### Problem Name: `wavy`

#### Problem Statement:

You're at the beach, and the waves are doing their thing â€” rising up and falling back down. Your job? Simulate a numeric wave ðŸŒŠ.

Given a number `n`, print the numbers going **up from 1 to `n`**, then **back down to 1**. Just like a wave. Easy, breezy, wavy.

#### Input:

* One integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000), the height of the wave. No, not the actual beach wave. A number wave.

#### Output:

* A single line with the numbers going up from `1` to `n`, then back down to `1`, space-separated.

#### Example:

**Input:**

```
5
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
```

#### Notes:

* No need for sunscreen.
* Don't overthink it â€” just go up, then come back down.
* Yes, `n` will always be at the peak. It's the star of the show.
